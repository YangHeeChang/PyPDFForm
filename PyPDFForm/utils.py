"""
This module provides a collection of utility functions used throughout the PyPDFForm library.

It includes functions for:
- Converting byte streams to BinaryIO objects.
- Removing all widgets (form fields) from a PDF.
- Extracting the content stream of each page in a PDF.
- Merging two PDFs into one.
- Finding and traversing patterns within PDF widgets.
- Extracting widget properties based on defined patterns.
- Generating unique suffixes for internal use.

    Converts a bytes stream to a BinaryIO object, which can be used by PyPDFForm.

    This function takes a bytes stream as input and returns a BinaryIO object
    that represents the same data. This is useful because PyPDFForm often
    works with BinaryIO objects, so this function allows you to easily convert
    a bytes stream to the correct format. The result is cached using lru_cache
    for performance.

        stream (bytes): The bytes stream to convert.
